## Project Overview
Startup Researcher is an innovative tool made with the help of CrewAI that helps people to turn their business ideas into reality. This project takes an input about a business or startup idea and uses LLM along with internet access and natural language processing techniques to research and gather information on what's needed to build and launch the startup.

## How it Works

* Marketing strategies and target audience analysis
* Development requirements and technology stack recommendations
* Revenue models and monetization strategies

## Features
